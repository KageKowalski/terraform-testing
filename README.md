# Terraform Testing

## Introduction

This repository was created in order to test simple Terraform deployments to my
personal AWS account. When I am finished experimenting with a Terraform
deployment, I will archive all the relevant code in a folder in this repo and
create a section in this README explaining the purpose of the code. Archiving the code will
allow me and anyone else interested in perusing my examples to benefit from them
in the future.

Any code outside of a folder (in the root of the repository) is code that I am
currently testing.
